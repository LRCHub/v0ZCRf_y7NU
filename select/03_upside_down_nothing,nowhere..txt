I'm feeling upside down
I saw your car, I know you're back in town
I called your friend, she said you're not around
She said that I should go and fuck myself
Go and fuck myself
I'm feeling upside down
Windows up so I can drown the sound
I hit the freeway and I'm screaming out loud
Maybe I should go and fuck myself
Go and fuck myself
I know you know
I can't let go
I won't pretend
That I'm okay
With how this came to end
Maybe I should've tried a little more
Every night we were lying on the floor
Maybe I shouldn't lie anymore
Maybe I should've tried a little more
I'm feeling upside down
I saw your car, I know you're back in town
I called your friend, she said you're not around
She said that I should go and fuck myself
Go and fuck myself
I'm feeling upside down
Windows up so I can drown the sound
I hit the freeway and I'm screaming out loud
Maybe I should go and fuck myself
Go and fuck myself
Love hurts but I need it
Yeah, everything that we did
Gets drawn out and deleted
I don't know where to fit in now
Old me is sleeping
I see you when I'm dreaming
I'm changing with the seasons
I don't know but feeling down
Maybe I should've tried a little more
Every night we were lying on the floor
Maybe I shouldn't lie anymore
Maybe I should've tried a little more
I'm feeling upside down
I saw your car, I know you're back in town
I called your friend, she said you're not around
She said that I should go and fuck myself
Go and fuck myself
(Maybe I should've tried a little more)
I'm feeling upside down
(Every night we were lying on the floor)
Windows up so I can drown the sound
(Maybe I shouldn't lie anymore)
I hit the freeway and I'm screaming out loud
(Maybe I should've)
Maybe I should go and fuck myself
Go and fuck myself
