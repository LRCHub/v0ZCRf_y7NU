Michelle no Destiny's Child

[Spoken]
Alright
We got any Divas in the house?
(Public screaming)
I thought so, haha
This is for y'all alright?

Upside down you're turning me
You're giving love instinctively
Round and round you're turning me

Chorus:
Upside down, boy you turn me
Inside out and round and round
(2X)

Instinctively I give to thee
The moments we've shared
I cherish the moment with you
Respectfully I say to thee
I'm aware that you're cheating
But no one makes me feel like you do, hey

CHORUS

I know you've got your charm and appeal
You always play the field
I'm crazy to think you are mine
As long as the sun continues to shine
There's a place in my heart for you, that's the bottom line

CHORUS

Instinctevly you give to me
The love that I need
I cherish the moments with you
Respectfully I say to thee
I'm aware that you're cheating
But no one makes me feel like you do

CHORUS

Upside down you're turning me
You're giving love instinctevly
Round and round you're turning me
I say to thee respectfully
(Repeat 'til end)
